"""Module for collecting features from nested structures in data processing.

This module defines a data processor (`CollectFeatures`) that collects features
from a nested structure defined by a `FeatureCollection` object. The nested
structure can be arbitrarily deep, consisting of dictionaries and lists, with
the leaves of the structure being `FeatureRef` objects.

This is particularly useful for defining the output of a data flow.
The desired output features, potentially from different nodes, can
be referenced in a `FeatureCollection`, which the processor can then
collect. This simplifies the management and retrieval of the specified
output features.
