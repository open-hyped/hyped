"""Provides classes for defining and executing data flows as DAGs.

The data flow module facilitates the construction and execution of complex
data processing pipelines using a graph-based approach. It allows users to
define a set of data processors, where each processor takes input features
and produces output features. Processors can be connected to form a directed
acyclic graph, representing the flow of data through the processing pipeline.

Classes:
    - :class:`DataFlow`: High-level interface for defining and executing data processing workflows.
    - :class:`DataFlowGraph`: A multi-directed graph representing a data flow of data processors.
    - :class:`ExecutionState`: Tracks the state during the execution of a data flow graph.
    - :class:`DataFlowExecutor`: Executes a data flow graph, managing the execution of each node and collecting results.
